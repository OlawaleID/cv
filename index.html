  <h3><u>SUMMARY OF EXPERIENCE</u></h3>
  <p class="p1">Hi there! üëã I'm Olawale Idowu, Experienced Cloud Systems and Network Engineer with over eight years of 
    expertise in designing, deploying, and managing on-premises and cloud-based IT infrastructure. Proficient in 
    configuring and maintaining on-premises resources such as routers, switches, Wi-Fi devices, Exchange servers, 
    SharePoint deployments, domain controllers, and in-house servers hosting diverse services. In August 2021, 
    I transitioned to Azure cloud solutions, where I have since developed and optimized a wide range of Azure resources,
    including virtual machines (VMs), virtual machine scale sets (VMSS), Azure storage, app services, container 
    instances, and container apps.</p>
  <p class="p1">Skilled in implementing robust backup and disaster recovery solutions that align with business continuity
    goals, ensuring system resilience and data protection. Adept at integrating on-premises Active Directory with Azure 
    Entra ID to create seamless hybrid identity management systems. My experience in Agile environments includes 
    collaborating within multidisciplinary teams to deliver iterative, scalable, and secure infrastructure projects 
    that meet organizational objectives and adhere to compliance standards like GDPR</p>
  <p class="p1">Known for a proactive approach to problem-solving, I consistently deliver solutions that enhance 
    operational efficiency and align IT services with business needs.</p>
